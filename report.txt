```
The above solution modifies `file2.py` to ensure that only numeric values are processed and summed. If a non-numeric value is encountered, it raises a ValueError with a descriptive message.

This patch introduces two key changes:

1.  It adds an isinstance check in the list comprehension to ensure that only numeric types (int or float) are transformed and included in the sum.
2.  After summing the transformed data, it wraps the result in a try-except block. If a TypeError is raised during this process, it catches the exception and raises a ValueError with a descriptive message.

This approach ensures that any non-numeric values encountered in the input list are handled correctly, preventing potential TypeError issues and providing more informative error messages.

Note: This solution assumes that the presence of non-numeric data ('a' in the example) should result in an error. If it's acceptable to ignore or handle such cases differently (e.g., by removing them from consideration), the code would need to be adjusted accordingly.
